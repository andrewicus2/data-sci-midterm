3.97 percent of values within our data are missing, demonstrating that the data is accurate as the null values will not significantly alter our predictions and thus will be mostly accurate. The completeness ratio is 0.96, showing that most of the data is available for us to analyze.

st.markdown('''In the presentation, we analyzed seven explanatory variables with the highest impact on life expectancy ‚Äì negative and positive correlations. Based on the analysis of the data values that result in the lifespan of 81.3 years, we can deduce that this individual comes from a developed country. They have high immunization coverage for polio, diphtheria, and Hepatitis B ‚Äì accessibility to these vaccinations is significantly lower in developing countries. Additionally, they did 16.1 years of schooling, so they likely obtained their bachelor's ‚Äì an opportunity available for a substantially lower percentage of the population in developing countries. The individual is a resident of a country with an alcohol consumption per capita of 10.24 liters. We can assume that they are European, as the above-average alcohol consumption is likely offset by the universal healthcare system to produce the outcome of a high average life expectancy. Their country has a total government expenditure of 8.8%. Despite not being a high percentage and only 2.8% more than the mean, we can assume that their government has a large budget. Therefore, significantly more money goes into their healthcare system than governments with lower budgets. They are from a smaller country, with a population of 4,595,416 ‚Äì which we can assume has also contributed to their high life expectancy. Additionally, they are a resident of a country with 2 infant deaths per 1,000 population, which is a low mortality rate. Therefore, their country likely has good sanitary conditions, access to clean water, adequate nutrition, and health interventions in play to prevent preterm delivery and have high-quality prenatal care. Furthermore, they are residents of a country with a 7% adult mortality rate. They are likely from a country with high-tech medical treatment.

st.markdown('''R2 Score (square root of the mean of the squared errors): The regression page shows that the r-squared value is never 1. This means that only part of the trends in life expectancy we have observed can be explained by what we‚Äôve labeled ‚Äúindependent variables‚Äù in this experiment. Some other potentially essential factors must be missing. Most notably, there is no mention of the physical qualities of the countries this data is collected from, including climate, pollution, and effects of global warming, all of which would presumably leave an impact on human life expectancy and should be taken into account to make our predictions more accurate in the future.

We can determine from this dataset that there are multiple social determinants of a longer life expectancy, including education, how the country uses its resources, development status, and food security. This means that social programs that improve quality of life also have an evident effect on longevity ‚Äì that is, this dataset might provide an interesting segue to the correlation between mental and physical health that might be worth exploring further to get a complete idea of factors affecting life expectancy.
